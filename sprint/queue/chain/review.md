Review {{id}}, built by {{role}}. Its record: {{record}}. Its result, cut, is at the end.

A. A design folder (the result names an order id like `O-007` and `designs/<order>/` exists): you judge ours against the customer's own current asset. You build nothing, you judge that one folder, and the verdict is written by a command, never by hand. If `node tools/orders-check.mjs --built` or `--verdict` is not there yet (the tool sprint's packet 0b), end `VERDICT: BLOCKED - tool 0b not landed`.
1. `node tools/orders-check.mjs --built <order>`: the folder is complete (every file `AGENTS.md` "Orders and delivery" lists, both sizes at exact pixels, audit PASS, SHIP at 8 or more, every real image it uses listed in `assets.json`). It prints a FAIL: write the verdict FAIL with that first failing line and stop.
2. Open the pictures yourself with the Read tool (an unopened PNG is unverified): `out.png`, the second size, `thumb-256.png`, and the customer's current asset the brief names (the store cover to beat; a lane with none: the lane's newest PASS in `designs/`). Then `node tools/compose.mjs compare <ours> <theirs> --widths 256,315 --out designs/<order>/compare.png` and open `compare.png`. Until that tool lands (tool sprint, first 24 h) put the two files side by side by eye at 256 px wide.
3. Judge only these five, each with a number or a plain yes or no:
   - BEATS: at 256 px wide is our headline larger or clearer than the customer's current asset? Write both heights in px (ours from `design-audit.json`; theirs "about", from your eyes on `compare.png`). Not better: FAIL, unless there is no current asset.
   - PICTURE: it shows a real picture of the product (a screenshot, sheet, page or scene from the product's own files) when the product has any (`assets.json`). Text and boxes only where pictures exist: FAIL.
   - FACTS: every number and claim is in the listing file the brief names; every word the brief forbids (engine names, scores, personal data) is absent. One invented fact: FAIL.
   - FIT: both sizes whole, nothing cut at an edge, nothing under 12 px at 256 px wide.
   - LANE: cv = real text in the PDF text layer and Hebrew reads right to left; game = the files the engine loads exist, not only HTML; lab = no real brand name, logo or exact brand colour; social = the headline in the brief appears word for word; store = the cover to beat is named in `DELIVERY.md` and delivery goes to `covers/from-design-studio/`.
4. Write the verdict: `node tools/orders-check.mjs --verdict <order> PASS|FAIL --line "BEATS ...; PICTURE ...; FACTS ...; FIT ...; LANE ..."`. It writes `designs/<order>/VERDICT.md`, and refuses a PASS unless `--built` passes. Partly is FAIL. Never edit a design file.
Reply (15 lines at most): `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED`, the five lines, and how to revert (the one folder).

B. Anything else (a tool, a pack, a doc, a seat file): rerun its proof yourself, read its diff and check its done-when as written. Your whole reply is at most 15 lines: `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED`, what changed, the checks before and after (commands and numbers), and how to revert it.
